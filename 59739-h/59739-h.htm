<h3>
  HOMO ELASTICUS<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I tell you it is inside,<br />
  a substance no one has yet identified<br />
  or described<br />
  as something natural to flesh,<br />
  a glutinous secretion in the cells<br />
  that can harden and melt.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Milky, it clings to the gums<br />
  with a stickiness that fastens on the tongue<br />
  to be dumb,<br />
  or else stretches and winds a band<br />
  around the heart so tight, it has to snap<br />
  or loosen, springing back.<br />
  Fluid, it waxes the bones<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  to ease their impact and recoil as they bounce<br />
  over stones,<br />
  except when the latex thickens,<br />
  becomes too crude, more fat than resin,<br />
  and freezes in the sun.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="balance"></a></p>

<h3>
  BALANCE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  My head has no affinity with my feet.<br />
  When I stand on one heel and lean<br />
  on my axis spine, I reel to the floor;<br />
  I can not turn on a fixed orbit.<br />
  My shadow divides me by day and escapes<br />
  me at night, a trait apparently made<br />
  to confuse me, since I follow a course<br />
  without regularity or recurrence, my cosmos<br />
  inclined to alternation at moments<br />
  evident to no one, not even myself.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Who is reasonable?  A tightrope walker,<br />
  perhaps, builders of bridges, sailors,<br />
  mountain climbers&mdash;those whose direction<br />
  is indicated by their opposition<br />
  and held in a careful equilibrium<br />
  like a golden pendulum, its means,<br />
  each according to some counter force.<br />
  Lacking such moderation, I look for<br />
  wisdom in safety, and safety<br />
  in wisdom&mdash;and dangle between.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A two-legged creature, whose symmetry<br />
  goes paired from ear to foot, I find<br />
  duality a natural condition; a Chang<br />
  and Eng existence united in fact<br />
  but separate in fulfillment.  Parted,<br />
  we die, and together compromise<br />
  our right and left, depending which has<br />
  the stronger influence.  Made as I am,<br />
  the wonder is not that I sway or spin,<br />
  but manage to stay inside my skin.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  SIMPLE WITH COMPASS<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Consider the circle.<br />
  It is a miracle<br />
  of completion,<br />
  end and beginning one.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Reduced to a point or<br />
  expanded to a sphere,<br />
  its ratio<br />
  is unchanged by ego.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Compare it to the line,<br />
  that matter of fact sign<br />
  of direction<br />
  started but never done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Whichever way it moves,<br />
  how far or long, it proves<br />
  distance can go<br />
  only so high or low.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I think we should rejoice<br />
  there is no other choice<br />
  than straight or round&mdash;<br />
  makes life easy, I've found.<br />

  from a thousand wounds,<br />

  Meanwhile we endure<br />
  and suffer with some pride<br />
  that we can be so human&mdash;<br />
  enough, if we must, to cry.<br />

<h3>
  AFTER THE STORM<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  That morning, after the storm,<br />
  everyone gathered about the tree<br />
  and marveled at its fall:<br />
  the body leaning gently on one arm,<br />
  its mighty head now cushioned by deep<br />
  branches, seemingly asleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You wouldn't think a storm," one said,<br />
  then broke off, staring at the fruit<br />
  that never would be eaten red<br />
  and sweetened by the sun, or set<br />
  in jars and slowly left to cool,<br />
  the ripening years ahead gone, too.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "It was the wind."  "The rain."  Each spoke<br />
  a part of truth out of his own mouth<br />
  with words that could not make it whole<br />
  because the naked roots showed<br />
  how much there was to doubt,<br />
  the secret in the darkness crying loud.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Even a tree, she thought, biting her tongue<br />

  MENTAL HOEING<br />

<p class="poem">
  Breaking the soil of her mind<br />
  was an old habit as she plied<br />
  the hoe back and forth over the year<br />
  to see its design, the cut and stripped<br />
  images of reason stacked in rows<br />
  of answered arguments.  She swore<br />
  at the stones, the matted grass<br />
  and stubborn clay that held her back<br />
  as though to a winter still unprepared<br />
  for spring.  Was she never to be spared<br />
  from questions rooted in the past?<br />
  She attacked the clods with wrath<br />
  until there were holes in the ground,<br />
  then her thoughts crumpled down,<br />
  taking her strength with them.<br />
  Aching from remembered resentment,<br />
  she turned to the struggle within herself,<br />
  but moved lightly now and penitent,<br />
  trying to ease the rebellious soil<br />
  and soften it, to make it pliable<br />
  to the new seeds, the new demands<br />
  of the changing season, knowing plants<br />
  thrive better in kindness than bitterness.<br />
  And suddenly the year stood plain, at rest.<br />

  HUNGER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Hunger, I have known your pangs,<br />
  the gnawing urge, the ceaseless demand<br />
  from beginning to end;<br />
  inevitable as air and light,<br />
  as rain and seed and soil, as tides<br />
  and seasons; the perpetual cause<br />
  of all that moves and is moved; the force<br />
  that flows through stars and men.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We are born hungry.  Begins<br />
  the appetite with warmth and tit,<br />
  with wombskin quivering yet<br />
  from cry replying cry, then another sense<br />
  commands another hunger fed<br />
  to feed the next and the next, each heir<br />
  and progenitor of this past,<br />
  that future, and the cycle reset.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hungry pilgrims, we can not rest.<br />
  Distance is but another nearness,<br />
  as soon met, then shorelines bend<br />
  and we must home again<br />
  to other journeys, our Eden<br />
  faith a continual repetition<br />
  of arks and floods from which none<br />
  returns invulnerable, the apple bitten.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Creed, color, race, we have all sworn<br />
  allegiance, fought bitter wars,<br />
  tasted glory and gall<br />
  for insatiable gods deified<br />
  by our own hungers; with rites and sacrifice<br />
  made bread and wine from flesh and blood<br />
  that we might have eternal food<br />
  here and hereafter, immortal.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We are fed by desire<br />
  and consumed like the fire<br />
  on our tongues, in our hearts;<br />
  a flame forever unappeased<br />
  by our words, symbols, deeds<br />
  or monuments; the phoenix, man himself,<br />
  recreated from his own ashes<br />
  out of hungering dreams and parched.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We live with hunger always,<br />
  that fearfilling, painpinching cave<br />
  wherein we hide like hunted stags,<br />
  lips dry, but tasting heroically<br />
  of miracles...  Who has not seen<br />
  visionary lions fall to dust<br />
  and, scornful of the world's ambition,<br />
  left the hunters truth in rags?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fish, birds, beasts, all are prey<br />
  to the same illusion, all wake<br />

  plains thrust toward implacable peaks,<br />
  time moves unfulfilled and blind<br />
  from plans unrealized to those surprised.<br />
  We die hungry even while hyenas howl.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The day to day commitment to failure<br />
  that judgment daily argues against me<br />

  wisest men and then, intentionally.<br />
  But my silence, like all my secrecies,<br />
  has no defense, none conventionally,<br />
  my personal idiosyncrasies<br />
  no social crimes.  When pride is pain and shame<br />
  an agony too keen for reason, I<br />
  had no other weapon.  Who is to blame?<br />
  There was no intent to deceive or lie.<br />
  My absence is sufficient evidence,<br />
  voluntary exile, not providence.<br />

  THE CHANGING WIND<br />

<p class="poem">
  Now there are great numbers of people<br />

  and the wind seems changed;<br />
  its voice is never still<br />
  and its eyes are strange.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Once, we remember, it was possible<br />
  for the wind to move on two feet<br />
  and formulate a philosophy<br />
  of life and death by reason<br />
  of environment.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then the wind that blew around us<br />

<p class="poem">
  When it was far, we could gaze<br />

<p class="poem">

  what a man puts into his mouth<br />
  he eats, where he lays his head<br />
  is shelter, that the clothing<br />
  he wears, covers him.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then we had no illusions<br />
  about customs or differences,<br />
  since the wind was the same wind,<br />
  whether it came from the north, the south,<br />
  the east, or the west.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Time was a place, we remember,<br />

  and remain long enough to hear<br />
  what he had to say.<br />
</p>

  then limped some more and paused, the bills<br />

  THE REFUGEES
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  After the burning nights and the barren speech,<br />
  after the dry wind through stony streets,<br />
  we found our little green where lilies were,<br />
  and knee-deep oxen stood watching us<br />
  triumphant under trees.  For this was peace<br />
  as nature meant nature's peace to be,<br />
  with fruitful soil made ready by its need,<br />
  with instincts tamed in gentler ways than fear,<br />
  with freedom measured freely as the sky<br />
  measures breath.  We lay there side by side<br />
  breathing kisses, feeling the wet and cool<br />
  of bodies grassed in loving, each a groove<br />
  within a groove, seeking counterpart,<br />
  with close-open-close, with light-in-dark<br />
  and waves lapping.  We heard the overflow<br />
  of lake down buttressed dam and sluiced walls<br />
  making music in ditches, singing birth<br />
  to seed in spike, to trunk in root, one surge<br />
  alike in all.  Then, happily, we chose<br />
  which way, and barefoot climbed the gold<br />
  to tip the rim of that day's widened<br />
  cup, before the darkness could descend<br />
  to cheat our purpose.  Together, all of us swam,<br />
  caught in a shower of light that fell on hands<br />
  and hoofs, on flesh and hide&mdash;the rainbow now<br />
  a shore towards which we moved with one accord.<br />
  And the sun ceased fire and lowered its arms,<br />
  promising new terms for our tomorrow.<br />

find the words to say it.  The words no one else had yet found or said.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
What is it? he repeated.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Her eyes an open darkness.  Leading to a corridor of black mirrors.  As
though at the end was a locked door and behind it the final secret.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
What?
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Within that hallway of silence, her breathing, the beating of her heart.
As though echoing his questions.  Waiting, hoping for the answers.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
If you would tell me, he said.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Pinpoints of light straining towards the threshold through a soft warm mist.
As though they would help him to see, to slip across barriers of being.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
If I knew&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Blind beams behind opaque windows.  As though in an act of desperation,
a man might hurl a stone.  The shuddering tinkle of shattered glass.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Here, he said, you take the stone.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Placing it in her hands so that she could feel it, roll it between her palms,
sense it through her fingers.  An ineffable, tangible continuum.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I give it to you, it's yours.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The whole, beautiful truth, God helping.  Love solidly immured within its
mineral heart.  Ticking away the centuries, immune to change.

<p class="poem">
  The needle between her fingers<br />
  came to a pause as she smoothed<br />
  the seams of her life and lingered<br />
  over old threads of truth<br />
  she had stitched with her own hands<br />
  and bitten off her with her own mouth,<br />
  noticing how these had blended<br />
  with and become part of the cloth,<br />
  until her dimmed eyes could not tell<br />
  in the fading light which was which.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There was not much of the garment left<br />
  to mend, although the remembering hid<br />
  what there was and changed the facts<br />
  of dark wool to the brighter silk<br />
  of summers past, when she had matched<br />
  her wardrobe to her hopes and risked<br />
  the need for later alterations,<br />
  unmindful how both would grow outstyled<br />
  and she herself become a pattern<br />
  of an age more pitied than admired.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Again the needle swayed and she sighed<br />
  at its impatience, as though it cared<br />
  that wool wear a rocking-chair pride<br />
  with dignity, as though an air<br />
  of mutual warmth existed between<br />
  her and the winter which would help them<br />
  keep what little vanity remained,<br />
  and the thread grew taut again,<br />
  leaving the stitches along the seam<br />
  smooth and even as her last defense.<br />

  THE SACRAMENT<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  All the breadlong day she moved about the house<br />
  and nibbled at its crust, until she saw Carl<br />
  walking griefwards with his shadow to the barn,<br />
  whereless in his step and heedless of the cows,<br />
  and she wondered how he could be so thoughtbound.<br />
  What sad, whyful thing could make a man so lost<br />
  within his world that he had no fisthold on<br />
  it to demand a moreness for his account?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She turned from that window to the hopeside one<br />
  where she had reseeded a world of her own,<br />
  a garden like the days of her truthhood&mdash;green,<br />
  and fenced in its innocence, flowering trust,<br />
  where flowers became their dreams when they woke up.<br />
  Reminded by the sky hanging out the moon,<br />
  she hung hers in the doorway, then lit the room<br />
  and hurried to her oven's tomorrow crumbs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He came in quietly and guilt-rubbed his face,<br />
  seeing Jen's waiting at the table.  "Ev'ning,"<br />
  he said and heard her reply creak underneath<br />
  as he woodenly walked to the sink and draped<br />
  a towel around his neck, unwishing the blame.<br />
  If soap and water clean could make a man feel<br />
  holy, what use would the devil's mirror be?<br />
  He felt no such deception while she said grace.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They ate their silence from faithworn plates and spoons,<br />
  swallowing the forgiven coffee used twice<br />
  each day and aware of the greater trespass<br />
  they shared in this house which was their staybetween.<br />
  Cracked like their hands and cups, who knew when its seams<br />
  would give?  In the fearwhile, the question unasked<br />
  kept their lips still, as though words tempted a risk<br />
  beyond their strength to mend should the seams be loosed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The meal done, she freed the table from its chore<br />
  and brought him the county's weekly paper, their<br />
  footnotes to other people's answers and prayers,<br />
  then bent to her needlework, seeking accord.<br />
  Lost by, he stared unseeing at the words poured<br />
  through his eyes as though, shuttered against exposure,<br />
  the negative in his mind could be immured<br />
  in its acid and yet bring some meaning forth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For a hurt away and far as a man might walk<br />
  on a friendly day to a neighbor's door, lay<br />
  Nielsen's farm, a credit to God had He made<br />
  it with His hands, but none to the man whose straw<br />
  grew luckside up as though his plow left a spore<br />
  of gold in every furrow.  It was a trade<br />
  so many seasons back, the reasons became<br />
  changestricken at this stranger who sat absorbed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Touched to the slow, Carl paused and tested the bowl<br />
  of his pipe, needing a valid doubt to prod.<br />
  Had he pawned his soul to find refuge in rocks<br />
  and let a waterfall drain in a sinkhole?<br />
  Through the smoke, he traced the wry and twisted road<br />
  down whenless years that had plunged him here to rot&mdash;<br />
  and yet, of Nielson he had required no bond<br />
  of hate, for this neither one had bought or sold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Torrent to trickle, not friendship had reversed<br />
  the law, but an unnatural love of worm for bird,<br />
  of plant for weed, of a sterile man for Merle,<br />
  a woman he could not wed and mark as cursed<br />
  without destroying the very universe<br />
  that had mothered her and which she owed rebirth.<br />
  "You take the farm and Merle.  I'll make my own world<br />
  over."  The words had been all too well observed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He had not known how close hell was to heaven,<br />
  not then and not while he lived in it alone,<br />
  watching Merle's seed grow beyond his graveyard slope<br />
  from buried dreams she never guessed were even<br />
  there, living as she did within her children's&mdash;<br />
  not until another came to share his ghost<br />
  and made him see that death was not like a coat<br />
  one wore and had mended by a wife named Jen.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All the thought round, he gnawed on the bitter rind,<br />
  hungerwhelmed for a taste of Nielsen's larder,<br />
  that orchard whose fruitening he had bartered<br />
  for peelings, and dry angered at the two mice<br />
  who squeaked in their chairs, each resigned<br />
  to his own corner of an empty cupboard,<br />
  but mostly ashamed because he could not convert<br />
  thorns into leaves, grapes from stones, thirst into wine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He cleaned his parched pipe from its ashes and stood<br />
  to wind a watch with broken springs, setting it<br />
  for tomorrow when his shadow would be hitched.<br />
  "I'm turning in, Jen.  You come before you cool."<br />
  His footsteps made the attic cling to the roof<br />
  as she folded her needlework's piece of silk<br />
  in a sewing box made like an infant's crib,<br />
  then raised herself and blew its darkness on the room.<br />

  THE BARREN FIG TREE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  In these long years of war I have seen<br />
  drought, and the truth is, Father, that I<br />
  am sick to death of it.  Can a man<br />
  set his house in order just to die?<br />
  You speak of hope and honor in our day<br />
  and I say hurrah for those not born,<br />
  for there won't be enough fig leaves saved<br />
  to cover their nakedness, or corn<br />
  to stop their cries.  There is no water<br />
  and no sign of rain, only briar<br />
  and thorn, dunghill and dust, while the poor<br />
  groan like beasts on a desolate moor.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You should have seen it, Father, the day<br />
  they attacked, a day as dark as night,<br />
  with clouds of fire both front and rear.  They<br />
  ran like horses, climbed walls, broke ranks, spied<br />
  out of windows, their faces pained, black,<br />
  while the earth bled till the moon shone red.<br />
  Well, old men have their dreams, and young men<br />
  their visions, but that day won't come back<br />
  until the mountains fall and the hills<br />
  cover us, if those are here still.<br />
  I've seen green land turn to salt, and worms<br />
  rot under clods, while men talk peace terms.<br />

  THE SOWER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Sixty seasons I have sowed, man and boy,<br />
  and I tell you, Matthew, that a seed<br />
  can not grow in the heart.  No, one may<br />
  as well throw it away or feed<br />
  the chickens with it.  For a fact, love<br />
  is something that only the devil<br />
  understands.  I'd rather put my trust<br />
  in stones and reap a quick crop, for ill<br />
  or good.  That way, you have no roots and<br />
  get what you can in a few short suns.<br />
  Or take cactus plants, at least a man<br />
  sees the thorns and expects to be stuck,<br />
  unless he's a fool&mdash;some choke on wool.<br />
  As for good ground, Matthew, that's just luck;<br />
  I've seen other fellows' orchards full,<br />
  year after year, where no one's lifted<br />
  a hand or a hoe except to pull<br />
  the ripe fruits down.  Some men are gifted.<br />

  His fists smash against the violet air:<br />
  the doors of evening must not close,<br />
  locking him out!  Why, is his youth a beggar,<br />
  crippled and blind, or reduced so low<br />
  that he should drink spit from the cup<br />
  of pity?  Snarling, he wipes his feet<br />
  on the mocking tongue that carpets the front<br />
  of a swank hotel, before the doorman beams<br />
  him with a eunuch eye.  O.K., beat it!<br />
  And he warms his hands with his breath,<br />
  then slouches off, his feline hips<br />
  rolling smoothly under bluejean pockets.<br />

<p class="poem">
  An expensive whore, desire taunts him<br />
  down through the city's bright bazaar,<br />
  like the cool white tone of a saxophone<br />

  Shop windows hive the honey on his lips,<br />
  the perfume of live mannequins clings,<br />
  while towers squat like pyramids<br />
  behind a desert moon now green.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Smolders the coal in his chest, burns<br />
  the hole in his shoe through the pavement,<br />

  overflow their Nile.  Thickly, he quickens<br />
  his course, begins to run ... till breathless<br />
  and unspent, he whirls and twists and crashes<br />
  beyond the guarded walls, the harem tents<br />
  of night ... a purple fugitive, who gasps.<br />

  I have not always been blind.<br />
  My eyes opened to the sun<br />
  like any child's, and I ran<br />
  and played in my waking hours<br />
  like schoolboys everywhere.  Night<br />
  was my sleep and the dark powers<br />
  I knew from childhood on.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I do not speak of the mind's;<br />
  the others came later, when<br />
  natural fears gave way to man's<br />

  of a boy's fancies.  Who will<br />
  deny there are worse dragons?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But I did not see the sign<br />
  of what was to come until<br />
  I was blind as Samson.  With<br />
  one stroke, I lost all desire,<br />

  when cold age pokes the heart's fire<br />

  RETURN TRIP<br />

<p class="poem">
  The recognition comes as it always does&mdash;<br />
  slowly.  One feels a sense of surprise<br />
  to find not all has changed: the blue of miles<br />
  above the snow-rimmed clouds of old volcanoes,<br />
  the tireless browns still ploughed to greening fields,<br />
  the red tiled roofs that accent time between.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The twenty years move slowly into place.<br />
  With eye as brush and sun as palette, a full<br />
  perspective emerges: as long ago today,<br />
  as near to far.  The wish reflects a view<br />
  almost transparent.  Past and distance blaze,<br />
  caught in a foreground of light, then shift.<br />
  The darkness grays, thickens.  One tastes<br />
  salt rain on the wind that blows through the mist.<br />

<p class="poem">
  You have seen the frightened eyes of the city glow<br />

  immense in the dark.  Only you, dark angel, born<br />

  WOLF!<br />

<p class="poem">
  As children we played "Wolf"<br />
  and howled its hot pursuit<br />
  along the canyons of our street,<br />
  wailing the bushy tail<br />
  that followed at our feet,<br />
  sidewalk to cellar,<br />
  lamp-post to door,<br />
  feeling the murderous paws<br />
  and ravenous breath<br />
  tingling the skin of our necks,<br />
  setting hair on end,<br />
  and circling each eye.<br />
  Wolf, are you ready?<br />
  Steady on the first floor,<br />
  he's coming up the stairs...<br />
  second floor, third floor,<br />
  he's stopping for some air...<br />
  top floor, roof, and now beware!<br />
  Rough coat, claws and jaws and tooth<br />
  will catch <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> and <i>YOU!</i><br />
  Oh run-run-run from the WOLF!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That was spring...<br />
  the taste of first free days outdoors.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Wasting no time,<br />
  in haste and thirst<br />
  we came to summer,<br />
  swinging...<br />
  making our own kind of hay<br />

  with dizzy drinks,<br />
  jazzy music,<br />
  hazy-crazy<br />
  cigarettes and kisses,<br />
  and aware of other dangers,<br />
  the wolfish ways of<br />

<p class="poem">
  By autumn, to be sure,<br />
  we knew the tricks and character of sticks...<br />

<p class="poem">

  we thought,<br />
  with a solid house,<br />
  genuine antique furniture<br />
  furniture<br />

  harvest enough<br />
  for such sound dreams<br />
  as conscience feeds on...<br />
  not hearing the creaks<br />

  the furtive glide<br />
  outside our doors,<br />
  until one rainy day,<br />
  what a storm!<br />

<p class="poem">
  Not again,<br />

  run...<br />
  We have set traps,<br />
  posted prizes,<br />
  sent out scouting parties,<br />
  and armed ourselves...<br />
  Waking at night<br />
  and trembling,<br />
  we cry, "Peter<br />

  FINAL PERFORMANCE
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A spinner in the green years, I trudge the snowdeep woods<br />
  to find the Rima trees where I was warm in silk through<br />
  those first winters.  Then the unwinding thread,<br />
  from which I swung by two spare arms and legs,<br />
  hung in the air like a gay trapeze, each vine<br />
  humming to the brace and pull and reel of child's<br />
  spider ways, an upside down dancer with her feet<br />
  in the clouds and the heart in her mouth a feast.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A beginner in the green years, my thick wool thumbs push back<br />
  the broken twig, the empty nest, the closed gray flaps<br />
  to summer's ringling tent.  Embarrassed, I lift<br />
  a rose still red and moist and soft.  Again I twist<br />
  its thin stem toward the light and dare the sky<br />
  to seize my heels and trick time's crafty eyes<br />
  till I repair the web and climb to one last height<br />
  before I leap &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; to catch the hands of night.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The cocks have been crowing<br />
  for two thousand years,<br />
  so I understand that part of it<br />
  and even expected, was prepared<br />
  for what happened.  This I swear.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As for tears, yours are mine,<br />
  since I am the cause of them,<br />
  and if I could, would take the blame<br />
  upon myself.  I know, you think<br />
  in terms of innocence and guilt,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  but that decision was long ago<br />
  made clear in an episode<br />
  of apples, bought in a hoax<br />
  for a song.  I recognize it still,<br />
  one we will always whistle.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And feel I ought to ask<br />
  forgiveness for you.  A turn of cheek,<br />
  if you like.  Why not?  Back<br />
  of every lie and denial<br />
  is the thing we all conceal:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  the inner hurt that makes our fingers<br />

  as though, by doing so, ours<br />
  is eased.  Let's admit it does<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  and, in comparison, sets<br />
  a better example, hurts less<br />

  And to begin to learn to live.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Love, you say, and I believe you,<br />
  yet there is self-love, too,<br />
  the fear of having to lose<br />
  not only a garden in the sun<br />
  but a chance to bloom anywhere once,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  which is more natural,<br />
  and why I say all will fail<br />
  unless each individual<br />

<p class="poem">
  This is the fatal trap<br />

  because no one is safe:<br />
  first comes Abel, and then Cain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So please understand me.<br />
  What you now do here<br />
  among yourselves to free and heal<br />
  yourselves from grief and anger<br />
  may yet preserve and defend the world.<br />

  THE MISTAKE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  In April, when she tried to take him there,<br />
  a farm where winter had not heard of spring,<br />
  where snow lay banked on rutted roads and winds<br />
  went shimmying up and down slick roofs and trees,<br />
  he took one look around and said, "God, let's<br />
  get out of here!" not seeing anything.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Luckily, night blanketed the backwoods<br />
  and they missed the bus, so they went inside<br />
  the house and she thought of cows in their stalls<br />
  and bread in the oven, of the simple life<br />
  collected here within its own crude warmth,<br />
  while he stood smirking, repeating, "You would."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The next year it was Washington.  They went<br />
  by train and all the way she kept checking<br />
  tickets, bag, baggage, feeling she had left<br />
  something behind, and though he joined "the tour,"<br />
  she realized with a start that it was he<br />
  missing and lost to everything new.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Everywhere was "like the postcards" and nowhere<br />
  "was worth the time and trouble it took to get<br />
  back from."  In fact, if not for the car<br />
  she bought for later trips, they might never<br />
  have seen the stars, how they moved together.<br />
  "Not all," he said, "not all," and they fell apart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It was like that all summer, and even<br />
  a continent full of moons did not change<br />
  the difference between mountains and prairies,<br />
  and she wondered how the others managed,<br />
  the men and women living there.  "Heavens!"<br />
  he said, "I've tried! Let's call it a mistake!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Let's," she answered, knowing she would stumble<br />
  over the same stones, up to the same door,<br />
  till she came to the last and final one:<br />
  single admission, standing room only&mdash;<br />
  which was natural, when it came to dying,<br />
  but no way to live, unless you had to.<br />

  Mortar and pestle made of brass,<br />

  by impure stars to common metal<br />
  in a foreign land.  But the level<br />

  each Sabbath eve was holy: lips,<br />
  eyes, heart purified by the tares<br />
  that softly burned, the week eclipsed<br />
  of wrongs she placed upon her head<br />
  in blameless white, reflecting there<br />
  the migrant image of a light<br />
  that moved a wilderness of tents,<br />
  made rivers part and mountains cry<br />
  the voice of God.  All this she meant<br />

  They would have us believe<br />

  THE SUMMING UP<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  On the library of my heart they have fed,<br />
  the worms of my living,<br />
  and now, surfeited, they are dead,<br />
  leaving their husks on the pages still unread,<br />
  dry, harmless little things<br />
  that crumble and shred.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ambition took the harder crust we dread,<br />
  the thick skin on the cover,<br />
  and gnawed with slow, relentless tread<br />
  the marquee lights for which it craved and glittered,<br />
  weaving letter by letter<br />
  a shroud embittered.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Love chose the softer, tender part, the bread<br />
  of my daily giving,<br />
  and made each ritual ahead<br />
  a carnage of communion as I bled,<br />
  praying for the blessing<br />
  I offered, instead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Knowledge went directly to the core, the thread<br />
  that bound my life together,<br />
  and bored its way up through my head,<br />
  loosening by stages the gold and the red,<br />
  until every chapter<br />
  I had written, fled.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now that I have finished with maggots and shed<br />
  their dust with some misgiving,<br />
  I am glad for the words not said,<br />
  for being spared the hungers other men have bred,<br />
  in my old age needing<br />
  but a tranquil bed.<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
